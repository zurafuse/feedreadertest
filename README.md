# Udacity Feed Reader Project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is the JS library chosen to perform test cases to ensure that each part of the program is working as expected.

## How to Get Started

Clone my [Feed Reader repository](https://github.com/zurafuse/feedreadertest) or download the zip file. Run index.html to run the test.

## Resources

[Jasmine javascript library](http://jasmine.github.io/)
[Udacity.com's Feed Reader project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)

## How to Run the Test

* Open app.js in the js folder.
* Study the feedreader.js file in the jasmine\spec folder to understand how each test works.
* Alter code or remove data fields to cause each test case to fail. (Refresh or Run index.html to start the testing each time.) After each failure, revert the code back to what it was before and rerun to make sure it is error free.
* For each error, take note and make sure the "it" message appears on the browser as it is relevant to which test case is being run.
