# Udacity Feed Reader Project

In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is the JS library chosen to perform test cases to ensure that each part of the program is working as expected.

## How to Get Started

Clone Udacity's [Feed Reader project](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader) or download the zip file. Study the feedreader.js file in the jasmine\spec folder to understand how each test works.

## How to Run the Test

* Open app.js in the js folder.
* Alter code or remove data fields to cause each test case to fail. After each failure, revert the code back to what it was before and rerun to make sure it is error free.
* For each error, take note and make sure the "it" message appears on the browser as it is relevant to which test case is being run.
